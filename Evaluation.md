# Evaluation

## 1 User Experience Evaluation

### 1.1 Task Success Rate ​ 
![stars5](/images/stars5.jpg)

The task success rate is the percentage of correctly completed tasks by users. This is
probably the most commonly used performance metric that reflects how effectively
users are able to completing certain tasks. In our case, in order to complete the task,
the user must only be able to use a messaging application and a remote control.
Since these tools are at the basis of everyday life, everyone knows how to use them,
and consequently the task success rate is high.

### 1.2 Task Time ​

The task time is basically the amount of time it takes the user to complete the task,
expressed in minutes and seconds. Time on task data can be analyzed and presented
in different ways, but the most common way is to present the average time spent on
each task. The user has to make simple choices and each choice has its own icon, so
the task time is really minimal.

### 1.3 Usability *

_* We need the opinion of the user to evaluate this parameter_

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is one of the most widely used tools for assessing
the perceived usability of a product by a user. Since this KPI is based on user survey
and cannot be calculated simply based on statistical data, it requires user
participation. SUS is a way to quantify the qualitative data, like user’s perceived


satisfaction of the product, and it consists of 10 statements to which users rate their
level of agreement on a five-point scale.

## 2 Technical evaluation

### 2.1 Required software

It is required to use your smartphone and use the Telegram application with a
personal account in order to access the museum bot.
The user may decide not to use an application that would require to be downloaded
only for visiting the museum, while Telegram in most cases is already present on the
smartphone.

### 2.2 Performance

The Arduino infrared remote control, that we use for the demonstration, transmit
distances up to 8 meters and is therefore fine for our application.

### 2.3 Devices dimensions

Our service uses simple pocket devices (a remote control and a smartphone), which
do not hinder the user during the visit.
The infrared remote control can also be hung around your neck with a string.
