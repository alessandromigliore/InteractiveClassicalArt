# Idea
![logo](/images/interACtive.png)

INTERACTIVE is a service designed for the Sapienza Museum of Classical Art and its goal is to transform the visitor's experience into an interactive and personalized adventure.
A infrared receiver is installed near each artwork of the museum and the visitor is provided with a remote control and a personal Telegram bot. 
When the visitor press the button of the remote control in front of an artwork, he starts an interactive conversation with the artwork! 
In fact, after pressing the button, he receives a message on Telegram from the artwork and is able to ask it all about the work and the author, and to test his preparation with a quiz!

Thanks to INTERACTIVE all the interactions with an artwork are saved in a database and the ranking of the most appreciated works of art is displayed on a web page.
In this way the director of the museum can have a general view of the trends whenever he want, and can make decisions to improve his museum by analyzing the data.
