## 1 User Experience Evaluation

### 1.1 Task Success Rate ![stars4](/images/stars4.jpg)

The task success rate is the percentage of correctly completed tasks by users. This is probably the most commonly used performance metric that reflects how effectively users are able to completing certain tasks. In our case to complete the task, the user only has to rotate a device in the same way he wants to rotate the artwork, to admire it from every point of view. Also to view the next artwork, we opted for a device shake to make the experience as simple as possible (All instructions are shown on the device in front of the user).

### 1.2 Task Time ![stars5](/images/stars5.jpg)


The task time is basically the amount of time it takes the user to complete the task, expressed in minutes and seconds. Time on task data can be analyzed and presented in different ways, but the most common way is to present the average time spent on each task. The user has to make simple actions to complete the task, so the task time is really minimal.

### 1.3 Usability *

_* We need the opinion of the user to evaluate this parameter_

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is one of the most widely used tools for assessing the perceived usability of a product by a user. Since this KPI is based on user survey and cannot be calculated simply based on statistical data, it requires user participation. SUS is a way to quantify the qualitative data, like user’s perceived satisfaction of the product, and it consists of 10 statements to which users rate their level of agreement on a five-point scale.
